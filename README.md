### Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was for Bobby and I to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to be apart of the mentorship program. Lastly, write a report on employee database analysis.

## Results 

We used an ERD to see the relationship between the excel files that were given to us to help make the analysi.


We use PostreSQL to load, build, and host the company's data

Lastly, we Use pgAdmin to extract the data

## Summary 

After finishing this analysis we can conclude thatthe company is be facing well over 85,000 unfilled positions all around the company. After doing the doing the employees eligiable for mentorship analysis we can also see that the number is not nearly enough to make up for all the employees that they are about to lose. I would Advise Pewlett hackard to start putting applications immediately so they can try to prevent the chaos that comes with lost of employees.
